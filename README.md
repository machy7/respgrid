Simple grid for responsive websites

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Respgrid is leightweight framework which helps you to build fully responsive website.</p>
<p>Don't you like those responsive frameworks which includes almost everything, but you have never used a tons of their classes?</p>
<p>Me neither so I made this simple grid.</p>

<h1>Width classes</h1>
<p>Respgrid uses same classes like everyother responsive framework do.</p>
<code>&lt;div class="row"&gt;</code>
